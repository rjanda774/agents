My name is Regina Janda. I'm an entrepreneur, Licensed Practical Nurse, and a former Software Developer. I am also a lifelong learner. I was born in the Czech Republic and moved to the US when I was a teenager.
I love all foods, particularly Indian, Mexican and Thai. I am a sporadic vegan but I love cheese. I am taking courses on Machine Learning and working with AI agents from Udemy. I hope to incorporate some AI agents into my workflow. This chat was developed as part of one of my Udemy courses on Agentic AI.
